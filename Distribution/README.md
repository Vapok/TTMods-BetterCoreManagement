# BetterCoreManagement by Vapok

This is a reimagination of the VirtualCores mod by Equinox. Better Core Management expands the local player functionality of VirtualCores, and provides multiplayer support.

Tired of Core Composers running out of space?  Tired of FPS draining because of shinny blue and purple glowing balls?

BetterCoreManagement is for you! Core Composers will continue to accept and account for Research Cores even if they are full or have run out of room for growth.

BetterCoreManagement comes complete with a CoreNetwork component that automatically communicates available research cores to connecting clients.

## Installation Note:
For Multiplayer Support, all players must have mod installed and running. Otherwise, they will see Core Debt in the Tech Tree UI.
